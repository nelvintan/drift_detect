### About

- This repository includes the code used for the experiments in the paper "Flexible and Efficient Drift Detection without Labels".

### Dependencies used in our experiments

- We use Python 3.9 and the following Python packages: numpy, scipy, and sklearn.

### Results and precise instructions to obtain them

- Experimental results: See Section III and Section V of the paper.
- To run the experiments, open the python notebook 'experiments_all.ipynb'.
- The code blocks in the python notebook has to be run sequentially to produce the experimental results.
